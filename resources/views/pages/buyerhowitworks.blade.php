                    <p>The Scoreboard is the most valuable feature of Scorng. This allows you to easily see which property you've liked the most or the least based on how many times you've given each of the 6 Scores. Each time you add a Score, the Scoreboard for that property is updated. Best of all, each buyer can have their own Scoreboard so you can compare and contrast.</p>
