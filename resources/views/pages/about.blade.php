                    Scorng was created to help businesses with the tough task of reviewing the many aspects of job applicants and ultimately choosing the most qualified applicant. We believe that our scorning system is the most effective way to objectively score and choose the most qualified applicant while also hearing from and discussing with others on the hiring team.

                    Our scorning system isn't a simple 1-5 rating. Our 7 score system measures against something concretely important, what the hiring team's or person's expectation is within each aspect of the applicant and their resume. Select one of the following pages to read the FAQs about the three most important aspects of Scorng, Score Page, Scoreboard and Scoring System.
