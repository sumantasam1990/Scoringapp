                    Scorng was created for multiple important reasons to help Buyers, Buyer Agents and Seller Agents. For Buyers, we wanted to give them an objective, comprehensive and detailed way to see how much they like or don’t like a house and more important which specific aspects of a house they like and don’t like and how much. This way Buyers can choose the house that they love the most.


                </p>
                <p>
                    For Buyer Agents we wanted to enable them to be able to know exactly what their Buyers are looking for in a house so that they can find a home that their clients will love the most, in a much faster way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Seller Agents we wanted an easier way for them to discover whether there is a Buyer who loves an aspect of a house that they are currently selling. This is why it is VITAL for Buyer Agents to invite every Agent that they know to join Scorng. Buyer Agents can find a house that fits their Buyer’s desires without having to look through each individual listing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So Buyer Agents can earn their commission faster by finding their client a house they love the most and a Seller Agent can sell a house faster without having to wait for that perfect Buyer to come to them.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Agents can easily add new Properties to the Score Page so that they Buyers can add Scores to that Property. Buyers can also add Properties themselves. All users will receive an email notification when a new Property is added.
