                    Scorng was created for multiple important reasons to help buyers, buyer's agents and listing agents. For buyers, we wanted to give them an objective, comprehensive and detailed way to see how much they like or don’t like a house and more important which specific aspects of a house they like and don’t like and how much. This way, buyers can choose the house that they love the most.

                <p>
                    For buyer's agents we wanted to enable them to be able to know exactly what their buyers are looking for in a house so that they can find a home that their clients will love the most, in a much faster way.

                    For listing agents, we wanted an easier way for them to discover whether there is a buyer who likes or loves an aspect of a house that they are currently selling. This is why it is VITAL for buyer agents to invite every listing agent that they know, to join Scorng. Buyer's agents can find a house that fits their buyer’s desires without having to look through each individual listing.

                    Listing agents can market houses DIRECTLY to the buyer and their agent, potentially increasing the chances of the buyer paying more attention to that house and even choosing to buy that house.

                    Both buyer's and listing agents can easily add new properties to the Score Page so that the buyers can score that property. We require that agents only add properties that share similar criteria to previously posted properties that the buyer has given a positive score to.
                </p>

                    Buyers can also add properties themselves. All users will receive an email notification when a new property is added.
