                    <p>Scorng is built around Score Pages, 6 individual scores and a buyer questionnaire. Score Pages allow the buyer to add limitless amount of criteria, enabling buyers to see exactly which house they like and dislike the most, how much and which aspects of the house. This enables buyers to make the most objective, detailed and comprehensive decision and allow them to pick the house they indeed love the most. The buyer questionnaire allows buyers to add as many detailed criteria about the house they are looking for so that agents can add as many relevant properties as possible to Score Pages. </p>

                    <p>The Score Page allows buyer's agents and listing agents to post properties that they believe the buyer will like based on properties they previously scored positively. This saves buyers a tremendous amount of time because they don't have to search through tons of listing that they may or may not</p>
