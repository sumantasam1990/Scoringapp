                    <p>Scorng is built around Score Pages, 6 individual scores and a buyer questionnaire. Score Pages allow the buyer to add limitless amount of criteria, enabling buyers and agents to get into as much detail about a property and in turn, choose the best possible house. View how much a buyer likes or dislikes a particular aspect of a house. With this data, agents know what to search for when looking for new properties for their buyer's to score. The buyer questionnaire allows the buyer to add as many aspects of what they're looking for in a house so that both the buyer's agent and listing agent can add highly relevant properties to Score Pages.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Save Tons Of Time</h4>
                    <p>The Score Page allows agents to save tons of time because rather then sending individual properties to buyers, agents can simply add them to the Score Page and allow buyers to score each property. By allowing listing agents to also add properties, buyer's agents save even more time, because it cuts down on searching for properties to add. That why it's so important to invite every listing agent who you know and ask them to join Scorng.</p>

                    <p>Each time a new message or property is added by any user, buyer's agents will receive an email notification so they can stay up to date on the process of their buyer's house hunting.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Invite Listing Agents & Following</h4>
                    <p>Invite listing agents is the MOST important part of Scorng. When buyer's agents invite every listing they know to join Scorng, they tremendously cut down on the time it will take them to find a house that their buyers will love. Because each time a buyer's agent adds a buyer to Scorng, it will notify listing agents. Listing agents can then see how buyers scored each property and simply add any property that has a similar criteria that the buyer gave a positive score to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once a listing agent is invited to join Scorng by a buyer's agent, they are now automatically following the buyer's agent. This means that every time that buyer's agent adds a new buyer to Scorng, the invite listing agent will always receive a notification and can easily add their properties that match a criteria that the buyer has given a positive score to. This saves both the buyer's agent and listing agent a tremendous amount of time.

                    <p>Scorng allows multiple buyers to add their score for a particular property. This provides beneficial information for the buyer's agent because it shows them how much each buyer like or dislikes each criteria and enables them to help the buyers make the best possible decision of which house to buy.</p>

                    <p>Location Pages are essentially a public directly of Score Pages that buyer's agents have created. They are organized by state, metro area/counties and neighborhood/towns. This way any agent can see every Score Page within the metro area/county or neighborhood/town they work in and are able to view buyer's scores and add any properties they are selling that share a similar criteria that has been scored high. Agents don't have to wait for another agent to invite them on Scorng, they will always be able to see every single Score Page that has been added by every single agent. </p>
