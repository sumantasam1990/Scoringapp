            <p class="fs-5">Tremendous benefits to help Listing Agents not only see specifically the criteria that buyers are looking for in a house but also market similar houses directly to them and their agents.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Super Detailed Buyer's Feedback</h4>
                    <p>Scorng is built around Score Pages, 6 individual scores and a buyer questionnaire. Score Pages allow the buyer to add limitless amount of criteria, enabling buyers and agents to get into as much detail about a property and in turn, choose the best possible house. View how much a buyer likes or dislikes a particular aspect of a house. With this data, agents know what to search for when looking for new properties for their buyer's to score. The buyer questionnaire allows the buyer to add as many aspects of what they're looking for in a house so that both the buyer's agent can add highly relevant properties to Score Pages.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Market Directly To Buyers & Buyer's Agents</h4>
                    <p>The ability to market DIRECTLY to buyers and buyer's agents who you know like or love a particular aspect of a house that shares a similar aspect to a house that you're currently selling is incredibly valuable. Listing agents won't be able to message buyers or see their name but simply being able to post a property to a Score Page where a buyer will get an email notification of the property will make the buyer pay more attention to that property. Scorng allows listing agents to easily and quickly post a property in a Score Page that a buyer has given a positive score to. The buyer and their agent will be notified via email of this new property. This will not only of course allow them to see the property and but also to score the property. This will give listing agents data to use to contact the buyers agent and sell them on the fact that their buyer likes or loves a particular aspect of the house that the listing agent is selling.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Message Rooms</h4>
                    <p>Post messages that the buyer's agent will see. This allows listing agents to sell directly to the buyer's agent and point out benefits of the house that they're selling based on the buyer's scores and feedback on previous properties. Buyers will not be able to see your messages.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Notifications</h4>
                    <p>Each time a new message or property is added by any user, listing agents will receive an email notification so they can stay up to date on the process of their buyer's house hunting.

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Following</h4>
                    <p>Once a listing agent is invited to join Scorng by a buyer's agent, they are now automatically following the buyer's agent. This means that every time that buyer's agent adds a new buyer to Scorng, the invited listing agent will always receive a notification and can easily add their properties that match a criteria that the buyer has given a positive score to. This saves both the buyer's agent and listing agent a tremendous amount of time.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3 display-6 fw-bold">Multiple Buyers</h4>
                    <p>Scorng allows multiple buyers to add their score for a particular property. This provides beneficial information for the listing agent because it shows them how much each buyer like or dislikes each criteria and enables them to post messages, pointing out the aspects of the house that the listing agent is selling to each individual buyer.</p>
