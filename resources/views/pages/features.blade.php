                    <p>The Scoreboard is the most valuable feature of Scorng. This allows you to easily see which property you've liked the most or the least based on how many times you've given each of the 6 Scores. Each time a buyer adds a Score, the Scoreboard for that property is updated. Best of all, each buyer can have their own Scoreboard so you can compare and contrast.</p>

                    <p>Agents and Buyers can add as many properties as they would like. Each side will receive an email notification when the other posts a new property. So Buyers will know to score a new property and Agents will know to come back and see the Scores for a new property.
